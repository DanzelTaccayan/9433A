HTTP - standard way of communication to access resources or the WWW
Standardization: W3C & IETF
Original HTTP as defined in 1991
	-Runs on top of TCP/IP
	-higher layer protocol that takes advantage of TCP/IP
			-E.g. Packet Switching
	- is a stateless communication protocol: doesn't remember clients just does the job and forgets everything.
	-Port Number: A number from 0 - 65536
				: application uses this to uniquely identify each other
				:e.g. If App W on IPA wants to send a message on App X on IPC
						on the same hand 
						App C on IPA wants to send a message on AppB on IPC
				:IANA - allocates certain port
	- Socket: A combination of IP and Port
	- Web Browser: Port 80 by default
	- HTTPS: running on top of a SSL
		   : transmit into an encrypted data
	- HTTP Traffic : when credentials are sent on "HTTP" the credentials can be sniffed.
	- HTTPS: takes anything you put on the net then encrypt it.
	- Digital certification: to apply HTTPS on a web server
							- Self Signed Certificate: no third party that tells them who they are.
