	* Non-Persistent Connection:
		Only available on HTTP 1.0 or HTTP 0.9
		follows 4 steps:
		1. Connection
		2. Request
		3. Response
		4. Disconnection
		- A cycle because in requesting you need to do the 4 steps above, the cycle must be first completed before requesting another request.
		- Solution to Non-Persisten Connection are Persistent Connection

	* Persisten Connection:
		Request - sends an info about your request
		- available in HTTP 1.1
		- the connection is open for a brief of time

		Request Pipelining
		 - First and second request can be sent one after another you dont need to wait until it is finished not like Non Persistent connections.

*HTTP Addressing
 URI: consists of a URN and a URL
 	URN: Unique name for some resource
 	URL: Where the resource is(digital resource)
 		-parts: 
 			*Scheme (http or https)
 			  >file - local resource
 			  >http - web resource
 			*User info or authentication ccred
 			  >authority -deprecated
 			*Host - domain name of IP address: resolved to an IP address using DNS of the server where the resource resides
 			*Port Number
 			*Path to the resource
 			   - logical path sometimes it is not good to put the physical path of your resource
 			   - may be static(served as is) or dynamic(usually a script) resource
 			   - query: starts with a question mark
 			          : typically provided as key = value pairs with ampersand(&) separators between key/value pairs.
 			   - Special characters are URL encoded transformed into something else
 			   			E.g. whitespaces =  +
 			   			     / = its ASCI Code
 			   - Some are converted into ASCII codes
 			   - Fragment Identifier = starts with a # followed by a key value
 			   						 = typically used on browser end.
 			   - Schemes can be omitted with relative URL
 			   		*Absolute URL - starts with a scheme(Full address)
 			   		*Relative URL - relative to some place
