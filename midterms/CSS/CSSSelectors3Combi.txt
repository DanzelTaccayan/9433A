Simple Selectors
type selectors - choose type to edit
attribute selectors - target an element based on its attribute
	attr~=value
	lang|=value : target a language
	attr^=value : if value starts with
	attr$=value : if value ends with
	attr*=value : if value contains
class selectors - uses #
id selectors - uses .

pseudo-class-selectors(implicit class)
	dynamic pseudo-class
		link pseudo-class
			:link = unvisited
			:visited = link has been clicked
	user action pseudo-class
			:hover = on mouse hover
			:active = when a button is clicked
			:focus = when focus is moved to a particular element
	target pseudo-class
			:target(css3) = target element on link; if href #___ in same page
	language pseudo-class
			:lang() = select content language
	UI element pseudo-class
			:enabled(css3)
			:disbaled(css3)
			:checked(css3)
	Structural pseudo-class
			:root(css3) = targets root element (html header)
			:first-child(css3) = <body><p>THIS IS THE FIRST CHILD</p></body>
			:last-child(css3)
			:only-child(css3)
			:nth-child(css3) = uses mathematical formula ex. 2n+1 = 2(1)+1 = 3
										2(2)+1 = 5
					 = only 3 and 5 will be highlighted or changed 
					 = can also use keywords like odd, even
			:nth-last-child(css3) = opposite of nth-child
			:first-of-type(css3) = <div><h1>First child</h1><p>first child din to</p></div>
			:last-of-type(css3)
			:only-of-type(css3)
			:nth-of-type(css3)
			:nth-last-of-type(css3)
			:empty(css3) = if element is empty
	Negation pseudo-class
			:not()(css3) = all except condition

Combinators
	-Descendant coordinator (whitespace, space tab, line feed, carriage return, form feed)
	-child combinator (>)
	-sibling combinators
		adjacent sibling coordinator(+)
		general sibling coordinator(~)

Pseudo-elements
	::first-letter(css3), :first-letter = targets first letter only
	::first-line(css3), :first-line = targets first line only
	::before(css3), :before = add content before selected line
	::after(css3), :after = add content after selected line
