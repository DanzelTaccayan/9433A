History of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

Tim Berners-Lee wa the founder of HTML and his product was made attractive to the general public by Mosaic browser which was evolved at NCSA. It became popular and well-known in the 1990's when Internet had been developing rapidly. HTML was broadened and presented in different modifications. Internet depends on vendors and page creators who share the joint conventions for  HTML. Most users and developers understand that HTML documents must work in the same way on different browsers and platforms. The key benefit of HTML is its compatibility and it saves time for developers who don't have to create several versions of a document for different users. Otherwise the Internet would not be able to be so easy-to-access and the 'battle of Formats' would be a serious obstacle for the Web evolution.

Every new edition of HTML tries to achieve more unanimity among industry players and to make sure that the developer's documents will not become unreadable in a brief time interval. The vision of HTML developers is that the data on the Internet must be able to reach by all devices: computers with different platforms, browsers and characteristics,pocket devices,cellphones, devices for speech, and many others.
