<P>Functions</P>
<P>A function in java script is a
procedure, it is a set of statements that perform a task.</P>
<P>Sample function</P>
<P><IMG SRC="img/Java_Script_Functions_html_391c29b0.png"></P>
<P>Functions can also be created by a
function expression.</P>

<P>Scope of a function</P>
<P>Variables declared inside a function
can only be accessed inside that function and cannot be used in any
other place. 
</P>
<P>Recursion</P>
<P>A function can refer to and call
itself. A function that calls itself is called a recursive function</P>
<P>Instead of using 
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="img/Java_Script_Functions_html_d98c9665.png"></P>
<P>You can use (does not apply for all)</P>

<P>Nested Functions</P>
<P>In java script, you can nest a
function within a function. However, the inner function is private to
the outer function. This means that the outer function cannot use the
variables declared in the inner function.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="img/Java_Script_Functions_html_fb98aca1.png"></P>
<P>Closures</P>
<P>Closures are one of the most
powerful functions in java script. Java script allows the inner
function full access to the variables declared in the outer function
and the other variables declared in the functions connected to it.
However, the outer function does not have access to the variables
declared in the inner function. This provides security for the
variables declared inside the inner function.</P>
<P>Function Parameters</P>
<P>There are two kinds of parameters in
java script since ECMA script 2015. These parameters are default
parameters and rest parameters.</P>
<P>Default parameters – catches
undefined variables and you can declare a variable in the function
head</P>
<P>Rest parameters – allows you to
represent an indefinite number of arguments as an Array.</P>
<P>Arrow Functions
(Fate-Arrow)</P>
<P>An arrow function in java script
allows you to lexically bind the this value and has a shorter syntax
compared to function expressions.</P>
<P>Predefined Functions</P>
<P>eval() – evaluates java script
code represented as a String</P>
<P>isFinite() – determines whether or
not a value is a finite number or not</P>
<P>isNan() – determines whether a
value is NotANumber or not</P>
<P>parseFloat() – parses a string and
returns a floating point number</P>
<P>parseInt() – parses a string an
returns an integer</P>
<P>decodeURI() – decodes a Uniform
Resource Identifier created by encodeURI</P>
<P>decodeURIComponent() – decodes a
Uniform Resource Identifier previously created by the
encodeURIComponent</P>
<P>encodeURI() – encodes a Uniform
Resource Identifier by replacing each character to UTF-8</P>
encodeURIComponent
– encode a Uniform Resource Identifier by replacing each character
to UTF-8
