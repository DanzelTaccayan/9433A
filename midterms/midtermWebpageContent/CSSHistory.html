			<li><h3>1994</h3> - Hakon Wium Lie works at CERN - the cradle of the Web - and the Web is starting to be used as a platform for electronic publishing.
			Hakon saw the need for a style sheet language for the Web.CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is standardized by the W3C like HTML.</li>
			<li><h3>1996</h3> - CSS1 was released</li>

			<p>The W3C working group has members (around 15 in 1999, around 115 in 2016) who are delegated by the companies and organizations that are members of W3C. They come from all over the world, so the meetings are usually over the phone, and last about an hour every week.
			About four times each year, they meet somewhere in the world.</p>
