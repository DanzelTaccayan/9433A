			<h3>CSS Declarations</h3>
				<p>Declaration consists of property name and a value, separated by a colon (:); whitespace characters can appear around any of theses elements. A declaration appears within the declaration block.</p><br/>

				<p>There’s a large collection of property names that we can use in our style rules.
				This are syntactically called CSS identifiers. This are the labels usde in property names, keyword values , and at-rule names, as well as in element type names, classes, and IDs within selectors. </p>
				<h4>Values can be expressed as :</h4>
				<ul>
				<li>Keywords:
					<p>It is an identifier and it mus not be surrounded by quotation marks. <br/>
						Example:<br/>
						/  background-color: #000;<br/>
						X  background-color: “yellow”;<br/>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>Lengths and Units :
					<p>It is a measurement containing number and units only. White spaces cannot appear in between.
						The numeric value can be either an integer or a real number. 
						If the numeric value is 0, the unit can be omitted (after all, zero pixels is the same measurement as zero millimeters).
						But if the value isn’t zero, the unit must be specified.The units can be either relative or absolute, but absolute is used and is useful only if the the physical properties of the output medium are known.<br/>
					</p>

					<p>The em and ex units depends on the font size that’s applied to the element. 
						1em - defined as being equal to the font size. When font is specified in em, 1em is equal to the inherited font size. In font-size:1.2 em; makes the text 1.2 times larger than the parent element’s text.<br/>
						ex unit = height of the current font, normally the height of lowercase x.<br/>
					</p>

				</li>
				<li>Percentages:
					<p>It is an integer, or a decimal number that is followed by percentage character (%). There should be no white spaces between the number and the %.<br/>
						Example:<br/>
					</p>
				<img src="CSS images/Declaration4.png" />		
					<p>Interpretation of percentage values is unexpected ; for example, vertical padding refers to a percentage of the width—not height—of the containing block.<br/>
						Color values can be represented in several different ways in CSS.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>Hexadecimal Notation:
					<p>Hexadecimal RGB (red, green, blue) notation is the most common format, consisting of # character followed by three or six hexadecimal digits.
						Six digits - first two are red, second pair represents green, and the last pair represents blue.
					</p>

				</li>
				<li>Decimal Notation:
					<p>RGB - arguments are red, green, and blue. Valid range are from 0-255 which is equal to 0% - 100%.<br/>
						RGBA - red, green, blue, and alpha opacity that accepts value from 0 to 1.<br/>
						HSL - hue, saturation, and luminosity.<br/>
						HSLA -  hue, saturation, luminosity, and alpha.<br/>

					</p>

				</li>
				<li>Strings:
					<p>Must be enclosed in double or single quotes to be identified as string value. <br/>
					</p>
				<img src="CSS images/Declaration10.png" />	
					<p>But in doing your webpage, most of the time contents are placed in the HTML file.</p><br/>
				</li>
				<li>URIs:
					<p>Expressed using the following syntax: url(URI).<br/>
