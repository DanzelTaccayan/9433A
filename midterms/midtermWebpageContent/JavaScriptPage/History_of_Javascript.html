	<h2>What is Javascript?:</h2>
	<p>
	JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted,
	object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best
	known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many
	non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based,
	multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports
	object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
	</p>
	<p>
	JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to
	design / program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an
	event. JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting
	language, widely used for controlling web page behaviour.

	<h2>History of Javascript:</h2>
	<p>
	JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an
	engineer at Netscape. JavaScript was first released with Netscape 2
	early in 1996. It was originally going to be called LiveScript, but
	it was renamed in an ill-fated marketing decision that attempted to
	capitalize on the popularity of Sun Microsystem's Java language â€”
	despite the two having very little in common. This has been a source
	of confusion ever since.
	</p>

	<p>
	Several months later, Microsoft released JScript with Internet
	Explorer 3. It was a mostly-compatible JavaScript work-alike. Several
	months after that, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma
	International, a European standards organization, which resulted in
	the first edition of the ECMAScript standard that year. The standard
	received a significant update as ECMAScript edition 3 in 1999, and it
	has stayed pretty much stable ever since. The fourth edition was
	abandoned, due to political differences concerning language
	complexity. Many parts of the fourth edition formed the basis for
	ECMAScript edition 5, published in December of 2009, and for the 6th
	major edition of the standard, published in June of 2015.
