			<h2> What is CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)? </h2>
			<p>
				- The idea of having CSS was to separate the design and content of a website.
			One good thing about CSS is that when you changes the how it is presented, you only need one stylesheet to be able to apply it and to affect all pages.
			CSS stylesheets are an immediate addition to HTML. It is a language to be able to define format properties of HTML or XML tags.CSS had one feature that distinguished it from all the others: <br>
			It took into account that on the Web, the style of a document couldn't be designed by either the author or the reader on their own, but that their wishes had to be combined, or cascaded, in some way;
			and, in fact, not just the reader's and the author's wishes, but also the capabilities of the display device and the browser.
