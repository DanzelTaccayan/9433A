			<h2>What is a network?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Interconnected devices that communicate with each other (to share resource)</li>
					<li>A network is characterized by different nodes</li>
				</ul>
			<dl>
				<dt>Internet:</dt>
				<dd>Networks connected to other networks globally, that is why it is also called "networks of networks".</dd>

				<dt>Intranet</dt>
				<dd>Networks connected to other networks within a private area.</dd>
			</dl>

			<h2> Two Components: </h2>

					<h3>Hardware:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Examples: Computer, Laptop, Desktop, Routers, Switch, Hub</li>
							<li>Interconnection technology</li>
							<li>Wired -  fibre, UDP, TCP</li>
							<li>Wireless - Infrared(remote control), Bluetooth</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>Software:</h3>
						
							<h4> Protocols: </h4>
						<ul>
									<li>Certain set of rules to follow</li>
									<li>Example: Computers using serial communication(a bit per transmission) cannot send their transmission at the same time that is why protocols exist to fix the flow</li>
									<li><dfn>Put source and its destination</dfn>: Where to give and to receive</li>
									<li><dfn>Send Big files</dfn>: Chopping them into smaller pieces which is the work of protocols</li>
									<li><dfn>Packets</dfn>: are smaller pieces of data from a very big data that is beng send/ recieved (chopped data)</li>
						</ul>

									<dl>
									<dt><abbr title="Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ">Developed ARPA</abbr></dt>
										<dd><dfn>Packet switching</dfn> - chopping the data to be sent into smaller pieces and then are sent to the destined recipient where it then assembles the chopped data</dd>
										<dd>Store and forward</dd>
										<dd> 4 computers connected remotely (<abbr title="University of California at Los Angeles">UCLA</abbr>,

							<h3>Before the World Wide Web :</h3>
									<dl>
										<dt><abbr title="Wide Area Information Servers">WAIS</abbr></dt>
											<dd>A system that enables client to search and retrieve documents in a central database. Unlike the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>, <abbr title="Wide Area Information System">WAIS</abbr> does not link related documents together, instead documents are stored in databases where you have to query the document/s you want to retrieve.<br> An Example would be a document (Document_1) you are reading is related to another document (Document_2), in order to get Document_2 you have to query that document in order to retrieve it.</dd>
										<dt>Gopher</dt>
											<dd> A protocol that is used for searching and retrieving documents. It uses Indexes to Subindexes in order to link other documents together("Hierarchies")</dd>
											<dd> It was termed <dfn>Gopher</dfn> because like the animal Gopher it burrows from document to document until it reaches its destination.</dd>
											
										<dt>Usenet</dt>
											<dd>It is like a "Bulletin Board" or a "Forum". Its modern correspondence would be StackOverflow, and Reddit.</dd>

							<h3>1989 - <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>  was created</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Links documents that are related to each other by using <em>hypertext</em></li>

								<li>The motiviation for the creation of the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> is for the use of researchers and scientist</li>
								<li>In the past, <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> was only textual</li>
							</ul>

								<dl>
									<dt>Sir Tim Berners-Lee</dt>
										<dd>works for <abbr title="European Organization for Nuclear Research">CERN</abbr></dd>
										<dd>Created: <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>, <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, the 1st web server, and the 1st web client or web browser.</dd>

									<dt>
										<abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>
									</dt>

									<dd>
										standard language/protocol of the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>.
									</dd>

									<dt><abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTML</abbr></dt>
										<dd>Technology used to connect documents to each other.</dd>

									<dt><abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr></dt>
										<dd>URLs are used to differentiate webpages from each other. It also acts as the address of a webpage, it specifies the location and other hierarchal information.</dd>

									<dt>Web Server</dt>
										<dd>a program that hosts the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>.</dd>

									<dt>Web Client</dt>

						<h3>The Presentday: Sir Tim Berners-Lee and the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr></h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Sir Tim Berners-Lee and The World Wide Web Constortium are overseeing the evolution of the web(which is the semantics or the meaning).</li>
								<li><dfn>Semantic Search</dfn>: asking questions on the search engine would now be meaningful or it would tell you something.</li>
