			<h2>What is a network?</h2>
				<p>Interconnected devices that communicate with each other (to share resource)</p>
				<p>A network is characterized by different nodes</p>
			<dl>
			<dt> Two Components: </dt>
				<dl>
					<dt>Hardware:</dt>
						<dd>Examples: Computer, Laptop, Desktop, Routers, Switch, Hub</dd>
						<dd>Interconnection technology</dd>
						<dd>Wired -  fibre, UDP, TCP</dd>
						<dd>Wireless - Infrared(remote control), Bluetooth</dd>

					<dt>Software:</dt>
						<dl>
							<dt> Protocols</dd>
								<dd>Follow certain rules<br>
								Example: Computers using serial communication(a bit per transmission) cannot send their transmission at the same time that is why protocols exist to fix the flow</dd>
									<dl>
									<dt>Work of Protocols:</dt>
										<dl>
											<dt>Put source and its destination</dt>
												<dd>Where to give and to receive</dd>
											<dt>Sending Big files</dt>
												<dd>Chopping them into smaller pieces which is the work of protocols</dd>
												<dd><dfn>Packets</dfn> are smaller pieces of data from a very big data that is beng send/ recieved (chopped data).</dd>
										</dl>
									</dl>
						</dl>
				</dl>
				<dt><abbr title="Interconnected Networks">Internet:</abbr></dt>
							<dd>networks connected to other networks globally, that is why it is also called "networks of networks"</dd>

					<dl>
						<dt>1969 - <abbr title="Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency">DARPA</abbr><dt>
						<dd><abbr title="Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ">Developed ARPA</abbr>
								<ul>
									<li><dfn>Packet switching</dfn> - chopping the data to be sent into smaller pieces and then are sent to the destined recipient where it then assembles the chopped data</li>
									<li>Store and forward</li>
									<li> 4 computers connected remotely (<abbr title="University of California at Los Angeles">UCLA</abbr>,
									<abbr title="University of California at Santa Barbara">UCSB</abbr>,
									<abbr title="Stanford Research Institute">SRI</abbr>,
									and University of Utah)</li>
								</ul>

							<dt>1972 - E-mail</dt>
							<dt>Before the World Wide Web :</dt>
									<dl>
										<dt><abbr title="Wide Area Information Servers">WAIS</abbr></dt>
											<dd>A system that enables client to search and retrieve documents in a central database. Unlike the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>, <abbr title="Wide Area Information System">WAIS</abbr> does not link related documents together, instead documents are stored in databases where you have to query the document/s you want to retrieve.<br> An Example would be a document (Document_1) you are reading is related to another document (Document_2), in order to get Document_2 you have to query that document in order to retrieve it.</dd>
										<dt>Gopher</dt>
											<dd> A protocol that is used for searching and retrieving documents. It uses Indexes to Subindexes in order to link other documents together("Hierarchies")</dd>
											<dd> It was termed <dfn>Gopher</dfn> because like the animal Gopher it burrows from document to document until it reaches its destination.</dd>
											
										<li></li>
										<dt>Usenet</dt>
											<dd>It is like a "Bulletin Board" or a "Forum". Its modern correspondence would be StackOverflow, and Reddit.</dd>
