			<h2>What is a network?</h2>
				<div>
					<p>Interconnected devices that communicate with each other (to share resource)</p>
					<p>A network is characterized by different nodes</p>
				</div>
			<dl>
				<dt>Internet:</dt>
				<dd>Networks connected to other networks globally, that is why it is also called "networks of networks".</dd>

				<dt>Intranet</dt>
				<dd>Networks connected to other networks within a private area.</dd>

			<h2> Two Components: </h2>

					<h3>Hardware:</h3>
						<div>
							<p>Examples: Computer, Laptop, Desktop, Routers, Switch, Hub</p>
						</div>
						<h4>Interconnection technology</h4>
						<ul>
						<li>Wired -  fibre, UDP, TCP</li>
						<li>Wireless - Infrared(remote control), Bluetooth, <abbr title="Wireless Fidelity">WIFI</abbr>, <abbr title="Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access">WIMAX</abbr></li>
						</ul>

					<h3>Software:</h3>
						
							<h4> Protocols: </h4>
						<div>
									<p>Certain set of rules to follow</p>
									<p>Example: Computers using serial communication(a bit per transmission) cannot send their transmission at the same time that is why protocols exist to fix the flow</p>
									<p><dfn>Put source and its destination</dfn>: Where to give and to receive</p>
									<p><dfn>Send Big files</dfn>: Chopping them into smaller pieces which is the work of protocols</p>
									<p><dfn>Packets</dfn>: are smaller pieces of data from a very big data that is beng send/ recieved (chopped data)</p>
									<p>Internet Protocol versions:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><dfn title="Internet Protocol version 4">IPv4</dfn> - 32bits(4 bytes)</li>
										<li><dfn title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</dfn> - 128 bits(8 byts)</li>

											<dd> A protocol that is used for searching and retrieving documents. It uses Indexes to Subindexes in order to link other documents together("Hierarchies")</dd>
											<dd> It was termed <dfn>Gopher</dfn> because like the animal Gopher it burrows from document to document until it reaches its destination.</dd>

		<h2>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Standardization: <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> and <abbr title="Internet Engineering Task Force">IETF</abbr></p>

			<p>Underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web and this protocol defines how message are formatted and transmitted.</p>

			<p>Runs on top of TCP/IP</p>

			<p>Higher layer protocol that takes advantage of TCP/IP. Example: Packet Switching</p>

			<p><dfn>Stateless communication protocol</dfn> : servers dont keep information about clients in between requests.</p>

			<p>Based on a client server architecture</p>

			<p>Uses a request-response standard protocol. Example: The client sends an HTTP request message to the server, the server processes the request and replies with an HTTP response message</p>

			<p>Uses the Port Number 80 which is the default </p>
		</div>
			<dl>
			<dt>Port Number</dt>
				<dd>A number from 0 to 65,635</dd>
				<dd>Application uses this to uniquely identify each other. Example:If App W on IPA wants to send a message on App X on IPC on the same hand, App C on IPA wants to send a message on AppB on IPC, Port numbers makes this possible</dd>
				<dd><dfn title="Internet Assigned Numbers Authority">IANA</dfn>: the ones responsible for the allocation of certain ports </dd>
			<dt>Socket</dt>
				<dd>Consists of an IP address and a port number</dd>

		<h3>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)</h3>
		<div>
			<p>Running on top of <abbr title="Secure Sockets Layer">SSL</abbr></p>
			<p>Uses Port Number: 443</p>
			<p><dfn>HTTP Traffic</dfn>: when credentials are sent on <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">"HTTP"</abbr> the credentials can be sniffed. HTTPS prevents this from happening because it takes anything you put on the net then encrypts it.</p>
			<p>To apply <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure">HTTPS</abbr> on a web server, Digital Certification is needed, but you can create one yourself (Self Signed Certificate) </p>
			<p><dfn>Self Signed Certificate</dfn>: no third party tells them who they are.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h3>Client-Server Architecture</h3>
		<h4>Clients</h4>
		<dl>
			<dt>Clients a.k.a User Agents</dt>
			<dd>Any application that communicates with an HTTP server using the HTTP protocol.</dd>
			<dt>Web Crawlers/Spiders</dt>
			<dd>used for search engine, to show related keywords when a client searches for something, an example is Google's Google Bot.</dd>
		</dl>

		<h4>Servers</h4>
		<dl>
			<dt>Origin Server</dt>
				<dd>Physical web servers with different resources</dd>
				<dd>Machine with an application running(typically a web server)</dd>
				<dd>Waits for requests in port 80</dd>

			<dt>Proxy Server</dt>
				<dd>Intermediate machine; used for authentication.</dd>

				<dd>Gateway - <abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</abbr></dd>

			<dt>Encryption Tunnel</dt>
				<dd>Blind Relay between two points.</dd>
				<dd>Forwards the communication without knowing the data.</dd>
				<dd>Allows HTTP traffic to pass through.</dd>
		</dl>

		<h4>HTTP provides support for other functionalities such as:</h4>
	         <dl>
				<dt>Cache Control</dt>
					<dd>Stores certain things that has already been accessed on a storage location and then retrieves it when it is needed.</dd>
					<dd>It's foolish to refetch the same content when accessing the same website on different webpages so cache is there to make access fast.</dd>

				<dt>Content Media Type(<abbr title="Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions">MIME</abbr>) Specification</dt>
					<dd>Web uses <abbr title="Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions">MIME</abbr> to identify what type of media it is so that the other end could know how to process it.</dd>

				<dt>Language and Character Set Specification</dt>
					<dd>Protocol handles it</dd>
				<dt>Content/Transfer Encodings</dt>
					<dd>Sending Files/Text. Example: Sending Compressed files</dd>

				<dt>Content Negotiation</dt>
					<dd>Servers should know how to handle files that are being sent. Example: A compressed file should be decompressable</dd>
					<dd>Server and Client must agree</dd>

				<dt>Client Server Protocol negotiations</dt>
					<dd>Two Connections:
						<dl>
							<dt>Non - Persistent Connections</dt>
								<dd>Only available on HTTP 1.0 or HTTP 0.9, follows 4 steps:
									<ol>
										<li>Connection</li>
										<li>Request</li>
										<li>Response</li>
										<li>Disconnection</li>
									</ol>
								</dd>
								<dd>A cycle because in requesting you need to do the 4 steps above, the cycle must be first completed before requesting another request.</dd>
								<dd>Solution to Non-Persisten Connection are Persistent Connection</dd>

							<dt>Persistent Connection:</dt>
								<dd>Your request would first send an info about your request which would make the connection open for a brief of time</dd>
								<dd>Available in HTTP 1.1</dd>
								<dd>Makes use of <dfn>Request Pipelining</dfn>: First and second request can be sent one after another you dont need to wait until a request is finished not like in Non Persistent connection.</dd>

						</dl>
					</dd>
	         </dl>



		
		<h4>Things To Consider: </h4>
			<ul>
				<li><abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> uses a request-response standard protocol. If the client sends an HTTP request message to the server, the server processes the request and replies with an HTTP response message</li>

				<li>A server can also be a client. A suitable example would be: A client requests from a proxy server , the proxy server(The server which would now become a client) will then go and requests from a gateway. </li>

				<li>Client always pulls from server by request(by using the "PULL" protocol"): client -> http request message -> server -> http response message -> client</li>

				<li>Since HTTP is a stateless protocol, servers doesnt keep info about you
				it is possible to keep track of you actions in some webpages(E.g. Shopping sites)
				because of server side scripting technologies.
				</li>

				<li>Server doesnt initiate request but with the PUSH protocol in HTTP 2.0 it is possible</li>
			</ul>
			<dl>
				<dt><abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> 2.0 - "PUSH" protocol</dt>
					<dd>Now the server can volunteer/initiate requests
	         			E.g. Facebook's news feed </dd>
	         	<dt>Polling</dt>
	         		<dd>is the continuous checking of other programs or devices by one progam or device to see what state they are in, usually to see whether they are still connected or want to communicate.</dd>
	         		<dd>works with pull but not efficient because it wastes of bandwidth and process cycles.</dd>
	         </dl>
